# Dense-VO

This work provide a matlab implementation of rigig body motion estimation of aan RGB-D camera from consecutive frames.

*   **core**
    
    Core implementation of the camera motion estimation algorithm.

*   **weight determination**
    
    Some useful functions for new weight determination method.


# Usage

Few of the functions of this work (e.g. the conversion between )are based on Machine Vision Toolbox (see http://www.petercorke.com/Machine_Vision_Toolbox.html), it is not troublesome for you to install it.

*   Down load a RGB-D iamge data set.
  
    See https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/download. You can choose one of the set to run the algorithm.

*   Run the algorithm.

    Execute the main.m to run the algorithm.
    
    Note: Change the input directory to where you save input file.
